The majority of the application that i seek for you to create is rather simple and mainly consists of bars and formulas where you paste in information and thereby get a result. I have done the calculations myself about what and how.\r\nAnyways, the application is for the computer game &quot;League of Legends&quot;. There's this so-called Theorycrafting. In this case it concerns following terms: &quot;Magic Resist, Armor, Damage, Health Points, Healing&quot;. For these parts there are different sub-terms: &quot;Magic Resist-&gt; Flat Magic Reduction, Magic reduction (percentage), Magic penetration (percentage), magic penetration (flat\/directly)&quot;. These sub-terms are magic resist reducing, and take place in different orders. As for that i have done several calculations in Maple that gives you a result. I shall give an example: &quot;Enemy player has e.g. 40 Magic resist. The player you are has e.g. 10 flat magic reduction, 20% magic reduction, 10% magic penetration and 5 flat magic penetration. These numbers are subtracted from the original magic resist (40). This means he will now have (16.6) magic resist. This defines how much &quot;damage&quot; the enemy player will take, as magic resist reduces incoming damage. The same counts for Armor. Healing is a different part, but i shall also have the calculations for that soon. I am wondering how much effort that needs to be put in this project from your side of? At the moment i have 16 pages in total as a template of the app and the design. I have basically no idea how the calculations i have done in maple can be included in this application, but i hope you can help me with that. Besides that i'm not sure about budget, so it would be nice, if you could come up with a fair price.\r\n\r\n- Thomas\r\n\r\nPS. I have files etc. i can show you later if it's something you're up to.","options":{"featured":0,"nonpublic":0,"trial":0,"fulltime":0,"for_gold_members":0,"hidden_bids":0},"currency":"1","budget":{"min":30,"max":250},"jobs":["iPhone","Mobile Phone"],"bid_stats":{"count":1,"avg":100},"additional_descr":null,"additional_files":null}}
